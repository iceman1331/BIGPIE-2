			<li>Human practices, in terms of technical work, helped us cover up significant loopholes in the work with advice from professors we interacted with during AIIM.</li>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					<b>Change in Effector Construct</b>
					<br> Our design initially consisted of three transcription factors arranged under separate ORFs being translated and translocated separately via the T3SS injection into the gut cells. After it was pointed out by Dr Gupta that the translation ratios would not be stoichiometrically equal, we took his advice. We created a polyprotein with the 3 factors which would be translated and translocated into the gut cell as a single sequence hence having a stoichiometric ratio of approximately 1:1:1.

				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Change in protease used</b>
					<br> Initially, we had chosen SENP1, which was common in other cell types as well. Dr Varun Choudhary guided us on the usage of a protease that would be specific to our target cells. We decided to introduce a protease attached to the beta-catenin. As a developmental biologist.

				</li>
			</ol>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Dr. Chaudhary was able to help us understand the Pros and Cons associated with using a beta-catenin attached protease for our polyprotein sequence. But assured us that it would help maintain the necessary cell specificity and efficiently cleave the polyprotein since we were able to choose a protease of our choice.

						As part of our proposed implementation, we designed a pill to ensure efficient drug delivery in the intestine. We took the help of Dr Devarajan, who guided us every step of the way.
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Maximise Bacteria in Duodenum</b>
							<br> The objective was to ensure maximum bacteria reaching the crypts in the duodenum and the early jejunum. She suggested that we use a pH-sensitive capsule that will release the bacteria at pH>5. Since the duodenum has a pH~5.5 prior to a meal. The pill dissolves to release the drug the instant it leaves the stomach hence ensuring that the bacteria remain protected from stomach acids while being released efficiently in the duodenum and early jejunum.

						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Modelling Changes and improved drug action</b>
							<br> She advised us to enclose our bacteria in mucopenetrtive microspheres inside the capsule which would guide the bacteria past the mucous layer of the epithelium directly into the crypts. As a drug that needed to reach the duodenum we decided our proposed implementation work of drug design would require the advice from an expert drug designer who helped us remodel our pill for better efficiency of drug delivery to the gut. Which also impacted our modelling work as we had to recalibrate the modelling work as per the delivery mechanism of the new pill.

							<b>Regulatory requirements and ethical questions</b>
							<br> As per Indian law our capsule iBETA containing modified probiotic bacteria E.coli Nissle is characterised as a “new drug” not a probiotic. Hence it needed to undergo clinical trials and gain approval from government medical and bioethics committees. Our interaction with Dr Shukla, a diabetologist who worked in organ transplant helped us design and improve our clinical trials right from the lab stage to the final Human trials stage.
							<br> He initially advised us to focus on designing clinical trials for Rodents, then Rhesus Monkeys followed by the final Human Trials. Later he advised us to complete our project in cell lines followed by organoid work. After which clinical trials for rodents and final trials on humans would suffice.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Clinical Trial work to make our project market ready</b>
							<br> He advised us to focus on trials of late stage Type 2 diabetes patients as they are more easily accessible for the Trials. He guided us on picking the perfect models for our rodent trials that would help get accurate results, for both T1D and T2D models. He thoroughly studied our clinical trials and protocols, and helped us set the timelines for each stage of the process. He also recommended that we observe the impact of our system on the target as a whole, leading us to develop protocols to look at the gut microbiome, as well as to study cardiovascular outcomes. He understood the necessary regulations and approvals that would be required to reach every step of the clinical trials phase. From the numbers in control and experiment, the time periods we must set, to the wash-off step we needed for our human trials, he guided us through all of it

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
				We designed our survey in accordance with the guidelines proposed by iGEM HQ. Hence, informed consent and privacy/data protection were highly important to us and we got them approved by a professor working in the field of surveys from the Department of Economic Sciences at our institute. Also, our survey design had to be specific and unambiguous, with the goal of not compromising our survey by insinuating a “correct” response to any question. The participants volunteered to conduct our survey. Our survey was an anonymous survey and also any personal data like email id, name, location, etc. was not recorded. However, our survey was designed to help us improve our project and give insight on the public perception towards new therapies and Synthetic Biology. The survey was published on the iGEM collaboration page, social media diabetes forums, our institution, etc.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				The survey covered a number of topics including prevalence and awareness about diabetes, application of our therapeutic drug in the real world, knowledge and perception about Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). Overall, 126 people participated in our survey from all over the country.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h4 style="text-align:center">Here is some Important Information that shaped our Project.</h4>

			<p>
				First, we wanted to know about the preferred form of drug administration and the ‘tablet’ was preferred by most of the people. And also people were found to be more concerned about side effects of the drug to be administered. This inspired us to design mucopenetrative drug delivery system in the form of tablet (See <a href="">implementation</a>) and a kill switch to ensure safety of users <a href="">(Link)</a>.

						Dr Sharma is a leading cardiologist in the country, who helped us understand the difficulties patients usually face due to diabetes medication. He helped us analyse the practical impact of our drug on the patient and the relevant changes we must make to create a product which is patient friendly.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							He pointed out the struggle of using a glucometer on a daily basis and suggested we create an app which enables patients to calculate their pill intake depending on the insulin requirements of the body as visible on the app.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>
							While our initial plan was to use E.coli K-12, he suggested using a clinically approved probiotic which is widely available over the counter example lactobacillus, that can enable speeding up clinical trials and future steps in getting approval for the drug. However we finally decided to go with E.coli Nissle, due to our requirement for a Gram negative probiotic bacteria.

					<p>Despite having picked E.coli Nissle as our delivery vector we were uncertain of its survival efficiency in the small intestine. Due to Dr March’s experience working with Ecoli Nissle where he observed its survival and expression in the 3D tissue model of the small intestine made in the lab. We decided to consult him to understand more about the advantages and drawbacks of our chosen delivery vector.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Dr March was fairly optimistic about Nissle in the crypts, but expressed reservations surrounding long-term colonisation. He recommended repeated short administration of the pill.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>
							He was concerned about the immune response that could be caused due to the T3SS, along with the cells we’re transforming.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>
							He advised us to be wary of perturbations to intestinal flow. At that time we were considering using a plasmid which would have our necessary transcription factors cloned individually that would be transported separately into the crypt cell. He advised us to look at alternative delivery mechanisms to improve efficiency (compartments containing TFs).

						Our interaction with Dr Behl helped us understand the problems faced by diabetes patients. He advised us :
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							He informed us about the limitations of the current treatments with insulin injections. He explained that there are two kinds of insulin -Basal insulin and Bolus insulin present in the injections. The drawbacks of the current treatment is that insulin absorption rates are variable and it has to be injected into the subcutaneous tissue. While our therapy creates beta like cells which are glucose responsive and hence will naturally respond to the insulin requirements.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>
							He advised us to focus not only on Type 1 Diabetes patients who are prone to immune responses and hence may be more sensitive to the drug but also older T2D patients with 8 to 10 years of diabetes history.His advice helped us create the clinical trials for our work more accurately and with greater awareness.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>
							He informed us that most Insulin injections release the insulin into the subcutaneous tissue so it gets diffused. But in healthy patients there is movement across the portal vein. So our system is possibly superior to injections as it will also be using the portal vein and is closer to the natural functioning of the pancreas.

					<ul>
						<li>
							To complete a Risk Benefit assessment of current treatment vs Our alternative diabetes treatment with iBETA.
						</li>

							Ascertain Safety
						</li>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Ensure the targeting is very specific to the crypt cells.

						Dr Shukla was quite intrigued by our project idea and had several suggestions for us. As a diabetologist who worked with organ transplantation he was able to help us understand the implications of introducing GMO bacteria into the gut. He also guided us on steps required to to follow to take the drug from the lab to the market.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							He told us that despite the usage of E.coli Nissle our bacteria will be classified as a drug not probiotic since it is not benefiting the intestine itself.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>
							There is a possibility of Immune response due to the T3SS like fibrosis which can make it impossible for the body to function naturally. Type 1 diabetes patients are especially more prone to this.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>
							He informed us of stringent guidelines in India for the development of “new drugs”. Due to this we will need to work with clinical trials starting from mice, monkey. then humans. But he also informed us that if our project could successfully be replicated in cell lines and organoid systems. Then the trials with monkeys can be skipped to go to Human trials.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>
							There is a chance of cancer in IPSCs while no such response was found in mice. It is possible to observe something similar in humans.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>
							To work with STEM cells you will need mucosal cells might be better. All alpha cells must be in the centre with beta cells arranged at the periphery. It should be a 3D system of cells.

						Through email correspondence with Dr Toussaint we were able to learn plenty about working with T3SS in E.coli.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							In his opinion T3SS was not a very disruptive system for antigen delivery. He infomed us that several biotech societies developed approaches like Advaxis which are used for delivery(which is not T3SS but was an equivalent system and hence T3SS was a safe enough system).</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>
							With respect to our concerns about horizontal gene transfer, he believed it was unlikely that around 30 genes could simultaneously be transferred and work as functional proteins in a foreign bacteria. The chances of such an occurrence are very low.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>

						Dr Chaudhary is a developmental biologist who is well versed with the beta catenin pathway. Since we had several questions regarding the new protein cleavage technique which involved beta catenin. Sir guided us to confirm the changes

						<li>
							He warned us that impaired tissue regeneration is a potential source of concern, but given that the existing literature doesn’t support it, it shouldn’t be too much of an issue.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>
							He informed us that N-terminal tags on beta-catenin tend to impair protein function by preventing protein-protein interactions. This was very important,as it led us to attach a cleavage site to Map20 which is at N-terminus.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>
							We were attempting to create a protease cleavage system in which the polyprotein could only be cleaved in the target cells. He informed us that the Wnt signalling tends to be active throughout the base (including at the +4 stock), as well as the TA(transit amplifying) cells present in the crypts in the gut.This information is very relevant to the project but has already handled by the efficacy of our targeting system and drug delivery mechanism which will ensure high accuracy in the bacteria binding to the crypt cells .
